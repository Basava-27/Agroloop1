# Camera & Photo Functionality Setup

This guide will help you set up the camera and photo functionality for disease detection in the AgroLoop app.

## 📱 Features Implemented

### ✅ Real Camera Functionality
- **Take Photos** - Use device camera to capture plant images
- **Gallery Selection** - Choose existing photos from device gallery
- **Image Editing** - Crop and adjust photos before analysis
- **Permission Handling** - Automatic camera and gallery permission requests

### ✅ Enhanced Disease Detection
- **PlantNet API Integration** - Real plant identification and disease detection
- **Image Processing** - Optimized image handling for analysis
- **Results Display** - Detailed disease analysis with treatment recommendations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install expo-image-picker
```

### 2. Permissions Setup
The app will automatically request:
- **Camera Permission** - To take photos of plants
- **Gallery Permission** - To select existing photos

### 3. Usage Instructions

#### Taking a Photo:
1. Tap **"Take Photo"** button
2. Grant camera permission if prompted
3. Position camera on the plant
4. Tap to capture
5. Crop/adjust if needed
6. Tap **"Use Photo"**

#### Uploading from Gallery:
1. Tap **"Upload Photo"** button
2. Grant gallery permission if prompted
3. Select a photo from your gallery
4. Crop/adjust if needed
5. Tap **"Use Photo"**

#### Analyzing the Photo:
1. After selecting a photo, tap **"Analyze Disease"**
2. Wait for PlantNet API analysis
3. View results with:
   - Plant identification
   - Disease detection (if any)
   - Treatment recommendations
   - Confidence scores

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Camera Integration:
- Uses `expo-image-picker` for camera and gallery access
- Automatic permission handling
- Image optimization for API analysis
- Error handling for failed captures

### Image Processing:
- Automatic image compression
- Base64 conversion for API transmission
- Fallback to local analysis if API fails
- Progress indicators during processing

### API Integration:
- PlantNet API for disease detection
- Real-time analysis with your API key
- Comprehensive results with treatment options
- Error handling and fallback systems

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working:
1. Check camera permissions in device settings
2. Ensure camera is not being used by another app
3. Restart the app and try again

### Gallery Access Issues:
1. Check gallery permissions in device settings
2. Ensure photos are accessible
3. Try selecting a different photo

### Analysis Fails:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify PlantNet API key is configured
3. Try with a clearer, well-lit photo
4. Local analysis will provide fallback results

### Permission Denied:
1. Go to device Settings > Apps > AgroLoop
2. Grant Camera and Storage permissions
3. Restart the app

## 📋 Best Practices

### For Best Results:
- **Good Lighting** - Take photos in bright, natural light
- **Clear Focus** - Ensure the plant is clearly visible
- **Close-up Shots** - Focus on the affected area
- **Multiple Angles** - Take photos from different angles if needed
- **High Quality** - Use the highest quality setting available

### Photo Guidelines:
- **Plant Parts** - Focus on leaves, stems, or affected areas
- **Background** - Use a clean, contrasting background
- **Size** - Include enough detail for analysis
- **Multiple Photos** - Take several photos for better accuracy

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing** - Images are processed locally first
- **Secure Transmission** - Images sent securely to PlantNet API
- **No Storage** - Images are not permanently stored
- **Permission Control** - You control camera and gallery access

## 🎯 Expected Results

### With PlantNet API:
- **Plant Species** - Accurate plant identification
- **Disease Detection** - Professional disease analysis
- **Treatment Plans** - Specific treatment recommendations
- **Confidence Scores** - Reliability indicators

### Without API (Fallback):
- **Basic Analysis** - Local disease detection
- **General Advice** - Standard treatment recommendations
- **Always Works** - No internet dependency
