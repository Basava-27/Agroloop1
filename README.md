## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### AI Service Layer
```typescript
// Multiple AI services for better accuracy
const results = await Promise.allSettled([
  analyzeWithPlantNet(optimizedImage),
  analyzeWithPlantId(optimizedImage),
  analyzeWithGoogleVision(optimizedImage)
]);
```

### Image Optimization
```typescript
// Automatic image optimization for faster processing
const optimizedImage = await ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync(
  imageUri,
  [{ resize: { width: 1024, height: 1024 } }],
  { compress: 0.8, format: ImageManipulator.SaveFormat.JPEG, base64: true }
);
```

### Real-time Processing
- **Image Compression**: Reduces file size for faster upload
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple AI services run simultaneously
- **Result Combination**: Best result selection based on confidence
- **Fallback System**: Local analysis when APIs fail

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **No API Keys Required**: Uses free services that don't require personal API keys
- **No Image Storage**: Images are processed but not permanently stored
- **Data Privacy**: No personal data is shared with third parties
- **Offline Capability**: Local analysis and knowledge base work without internet
- **Anonymous Processing**: All AI processing is done anonymously
